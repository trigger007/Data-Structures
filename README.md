# Data-Structures
Data Structures in C++ language
in progress

### Linked List (linkedlist.cpp)
* It contains all the functions except sorting right now.
* Just run the code and you would understand how it is working.

### Binary Search Tree (bst.cpp)

* innum() to take input of a number(to find that number in tree)
* addelement() to add element after the tree has been created. Calls the insertnum after taking input.
* insertnum() finds the appropriate position for the number in the tree.

### Stack (stack.cpp) using Linked List
* working and easy to understand


###### Adding a Binary tree file soon
